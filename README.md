Project Name: Duck n Roll

For this game I had no clear vision of what I wanted to do but I was given a lot of tools to use from previous projects. I wanted to stick to the 2d-2.5d theme and decided to remix things from Apple Picker, Mission Demolition and Roll a ball. 

From Roll a ball I used the player script but added a jump function along with other inputs from the user such as a pause menu when pressing escape.
From Apple Picker I used the tree and apples idea and changed it to become a UFO that shoots little rocks. Also added in some sounds.
From Mission Demolition I used the trigger events that we learned and used it for creating a health bar for both the player and UFO.

All game modes have a pause menu that will allow you to return to the hub.
Objective: Bonk the UFO.
Duck n Roll Controls:
Escape - Main Menu
R - restart the game
A - Left
d - Right
